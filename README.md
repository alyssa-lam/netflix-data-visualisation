# Netflix Data Visualisation

## Summary
This project provides insights into Netflix movie data up to 2025, focusing on key factors like budget, genre, country of origin, and metrics like revenue and viewer ratings.
Through a series of data visualizations, coded in R, we explore how these variables relate to each other and what patterns emerge from Netflixâ€™s immense catalogue of movies.
